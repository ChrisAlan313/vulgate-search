# Vulgate Search

> WIP: I'm working on it on and off. Nothing is functional right now. I'm just playing around with the idea.

## TODO

- [ ] Work on way to import Vulgate Bible file into either Rails memory or the DB
- [ ] Convert the character encoding to display diphthongs
- [ ] Display individual verses
- [ ] Display individual chapters
- [ ] Display individual Books
- [ ] Add way to search verses for matching words
- [ ] Find dump of the Douay-Rheims Bible
- [ ] Extend whatever classes we're using for verses, chapters and books to include both translations
- [ ] Display each translation together in the above pages

## Why?

I'd like to get a feel for the usages of certain Ecclesiastical Latin words by comparing the usages of it in different contexts in the Vulgate. This will allow me to view the Douay-Rheims translations alongside. As Douay-Rheims is a direct English translation of the Vulgate, this seems like the best way to do that.
